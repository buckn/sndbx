    Overview:

        Shader program 'quad':
            Get shader desc: quad_shader_desc(sg_query_backend());
            Vertex shader: vs
                Attribute slots:
                    ATTR_vs_position = 0
                Uniform block 'vertex_uniforms':
                    C struct: vertex_uniforms_t
                    Bind slot: SLOT_vertex_uniforms = 0
            Fragment shader: fs


    Shader descriptor structs:

        sg_shader quad = sg_make_shader(quad_shader_desc(sg_query_backend()));

    Vertex attribute locations for vertex shader 'vs':

        sg_pipeline pip = sg_make_pipeline(&(sg_pipeline_desc){
            .layout = {
                .attrs = {
                    [ATTR_vs_position] = { ... },
                },
            },
            ...});

    Image bind slots, use as index in sg_bindings.vs_images[] or .fs_images[]


    Bind slot and C-struct for uniform block 'vertex_uniforms':

        vertex_uniforms_t vertex_uniforms = {
            .model_matrix = ...;
            .color0 = ...;
        };
        sg_apply_uniforms(SG_SHADERSTAGE_[VS|FS], SLOT_vertex_uniforms, &SG_RANGE(vertex_uniforms));
